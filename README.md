## Overview
CheckUp is an app targeted towards those who love pick up basketball. There has always been a chaotic element to pick up basketball and CheckUp is here to minimize that chaos. User's are able to start games, pick a location, time, and add players to the game's waitlist. This will organize the runs in an efficient way, and allowing better use of time at the courts.

## Challenging Parts
Debugging. This was the first project that I wanted to debug everything on my own and research. I had many hours where I would go down a rabbit hole and felt like I still did not fix the problem.
